# 💱 Exchange Rate Portal

## 📋 1. Project Overview
A web application for tracking and analyzing currency exchange rates from the Bank of Lithuania. 
The portal provides real-time exchange rates, historical data visualization, and currency conversion capabilities. 
Rates are automatically synchronized daily from the LB.lt web service, with initial data populated for the last 90 days.

### 🚀 Key functionality:
- Display current exchange rates from Bank of Lithuania
- Show historical exchange rate data with charts/tables
- Currency calculator for amount conversion
- Automated daily rate updates via Quartz scheduler

## 🏗️ 3. System Architecture  

### 🔧 Backend Architecture  
- **Layered Clean Architecture** with clear separation of concerns  
- **Repository Pattern** for database abstraction (MongoDB implementation)  
- **Service Layer** containing business logic and coordinating repositories  
- **Controller Layer** handling HTTP requests and responses  
- **Scheduled Jobs** (Quartz.NET) for automated rate updates  
- **Helper/Utility classes** following Single Responsibility Principle (SOLID)  

### 🎨 Frontend Architecture    
- **Component-based Structure** with reusable UI components  
- **Service Layer** for API communication and business logic  
- **TypeScript Interfaces** for type safety and contracts  
- **Modular Design** enabling easy feature additions  

### ✅ Key Benefits  
- **Scalable Foundation** - Easy to add new features and endpoints  
- **Testable Code** - Clear boundaries enable unit testing  
- **Maintainable** - Changes localized to specific layers  
- **Future-proof** - Ready for database switching or additional data sources

## ⚙️ 4. Technology Stack
| Layer | Technology | Version |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Backend | .NET | 8.0 |
| Frontend | Angular | 20+ |
| Database | MongoDB | 6.0 |
| Scheduler | Quartz.NET | 3.8 |
| Containerization | Docker | 24+ |
| Documentation | Swagger | -- |

## 🎯 **Technology Selection Rationale**

- **.NET**: Chosen for personal expertise to best demonstrate engineering thinking within the test assignment timeframe. Equivalent Java implementation would be equally feasible.

- **Angular**: Current framework of choice for building component-based, maintainable frontend applications.

- **MongoDB**: Ideal fit for document-based exchange rate data - simple setup, no complex relationships required, perfectly suited for the data structure.

- **Docker**: Ensures consistent development environments and easy testing across different machines.

- **Swagger**: Provides automatic API documentation, making endpoints easily testable and understandable.

## 🌐 5.  API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/ExchangeRates/current/{region}` | Retrieves current exchange rates for specified region |
| `GET` | `/ExchangeRates/history/{region}/{currency}?days=90` | Gets historical exchange rate data with customizable timeframe |
| `POST` | `/ExchangeRates/calculate` | Performs currency conversion calculations |
| `POST` | `/ExchangeRates/trigger-update` | Manually triggers rate updates (bypasses Quartz scheduler) |

## 💾 Data structure

**Region Types:**
- `0` = LT (Lithuania)
- `1` = EU (European Union)

**Response Example** (Current Rates):
```json
{
  "id": "69013c620e140d2d5946bf1a",
  "regionType": 0,
  "date": "2025-10-28T00:00:00Z", 
  "baseCurrency": "EUR",
  "rates": [
    {
      "currency": "AUD",
      "rate": 1.7745
    },
    {
      "currency": "BGN",
      "rate": 1.9558
    }
  ]
}
```

## 📊 6. Data Volume Calculation

**Daily Data:**
- 90 currencies × 1 update/day = 90 records
- Average record size: ~2KB (rates array + metadata)
- **Daily storage**: 90 × 2KB = 180KB

**Yearly Projection:**
- 90 records/day × 365 days = 32,850 records/year  
- **Yearly storage**: 32,850 × 2KB ≈ 65MB

**Historical Data (90 days initial):**
- 90 days × 90 records/day = 8,100 records
- **Initial storage**: 8,100 × 2KB ≈ 16MB

### ⚡ Performance Considerations
- **Query Speed**: Sub-100ms response times even at current scale
- **Indexing Ready**: Database can be optimized with indexes on `date`, `regionType`, and `rates.currency` for faster searches
- **Scalability**: MongoDB's horizontal scaling available when needed

**Note**: Indexing implementation omitted in this test version but represents standard production practice for optimal query performance.
